# JED---Java-Editor-For-DataTables-
JED was written to support the JQuery plugin known as DataTables for the Java platform.
JED is the server side business logic for web applications needed to perform CRUD 
(Create,Read,Update,Delete) operations on backend databases.  Currently JED supports
database systems: MySQL, MS SQL Server, and Oracle.

The complete download package exceeds GitHub's maximum file size restriction, therefore, it is
recommended you download the complete zip archive package from our website.

JED works in conjunction with JQuery files obtainable from SpryMedia's website for Datatables http://datatables.net.
To obtain the javacript and css files supporting Editor for DataTables, you will need to go to
the website: http://editor.datatables.net/ and download the trial package.  Once you are satisfied
that all is working as it should with JED, and you wish to continue using the javascript
and css files that come with Editor, then you will be required to purchase your copy of Editor
from SpryMedia.
