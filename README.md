# JED---Java-Editor-For-DataTables-
JED was written to support the JQuery plugin known as DataTables for the Java platform.
JED is the server side business logic for web applications needed to perform CRUD 
(Create,Read,Update,Delete) operations on backend databases.  Currently JED supports
database systems: MySQL, MS SQL Server, and Oracle.

GitHub's maximum file size restriction prevents us from uploading one of the dependancy files, therefore, it is
recommended you download the complete zip archive package from our website.  It contains all
dependancy jar files and other resources.

Website URL: http://jed-datatables.net

DEPENDANCY FILES:<br>
1. commons-fileupload-1.3.1.jar<br>
2. commons-io.2.4.jar<br>
3. gson-2.2.4.jar<br>
4. log4j-1.2.8.jar<br>
5. tika-app-1.11.jar<br>

JED works in conjunction with JQuery files obtainable from SpryMedia's website for Datatables http://datatables.net.
To obtain the javacript and css files supporting Editor for DataTables, you will need to go to
the website: http://editor.datatables.net/ and download the trial package.  Once you are satisfied
that all is working as it should with JED, and you wish to continue using the javascript
and css files that come with Editor, then you will be required to purchase your copy of Editor
from SpryMedia.
